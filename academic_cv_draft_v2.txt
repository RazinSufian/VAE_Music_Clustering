RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

Undergraduate Thesis Researcher                            Jan 2025 – Present
Supervisor: [YOUR THESIS SUPERVISOR'S NAME — FILL IN]
BRAC University, Department of Computer Science

Thesis: "Dataset Creation & Disease Classification from Microscopic Pap
         Smear Slide Images Using Deep Learning with Explainable AI"

  • Created a multicenter cervical cytology dataset of 5,000+ Pap smear
    images collected from hospitals in Barishal, Bangladesh
  • Physically transported slides to BRAC University's Biotechnology
    Research Laboratory for digitization at 40x magnification
  • Designed and developed a secure web-based annotation portal enabling
    remote cytopathologists to annotate images — solving the "expert
    bottleneck" problem in low-resource settings
  • Built a multi-stage classification pipeline:
      ◦ Stage 1: Stain normalization (Macenko/Vahadane) for cross-lab
        consistency
      ◦ Stage 2: Cell segmentation using YOLOv8 and Cellpose
      ◦ Stage 3: Individual cell classification via ResNet152 + SVM
        hybrid approach (Normal, ASC-US, LSIL, HSIL)
      ◦ Stage 4: Slide-level aggregation for final diagnosis
  • Integrated Grad-CAM explainability for clinical transparency
  • Developing NLP-generated rationales for human-readable diagnostic
    explanations
